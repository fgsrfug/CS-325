Ensure all files are present, which are:

    insertsort.cpp
    insertTime.cpp
    mergesort.cpp
    mergeTime.cpp
    Makefile

To compile all programs, simply type "make" or "make all" to create the
executables.

If you would like to make just the insert functions or the merge functions,
type "make insert" or "make merge"

To run an executable, type "./" before the name of the object file you would
like to run. For example, type "./insertTime.o" to run that executable.

Making these files should result in the creation of the files below:

    insertsort.o
    insertTime.o
    mergesort.o
    mergeTime.o

Running insertsort.o and mergesort.o should create text files with ordered
results called "insert.txt" and "merge.txt" respectively. In these files you
will find the ordered lists.

Running inserTime.o  mergeTime.o will result in the size of the array and the
time elapsed to be printed to the terminal.

To set the size of the array in the Time functions, change the value assigned
to n in the functions, which should be line 179 for mergeTime.cpp and line 112
for insertTime.cpp.
