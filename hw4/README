Ensure all files are present, which are:

    mstEuclid.py
    Makefile
    README

To execute the program, just type "make" or "make all" or "make mst".

To change the file read in from the command line, enter the Makefile and
change TXT_1 to the name of the file to search test on.

The program should print out the the edges and the points that make a MST of
the graph. I know the text is not lined up. I tried to fix it. I have math
homework to do.
