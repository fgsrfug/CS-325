Ensure all files are present, which are:

    knapsack.py
    shopping.py
    Makefile
    README

To execute both programs, just type "make" or "make all".

If you would like to just execute knapsack.py, type "make knapsack". If you
wuold just want to execute shopping.py, type "make shopping"

Executing knapsack.py should print the timed results of the recursive and
dynamic programming solutions to the knapsack problem, along with other
variables like size of array, max weight allowed and the solution for both
methods.

Executing shopping.py should output a file called results.txt. This file
should hold the results of the shopping problem.

The number of items, max weight, or max random value placed in the
weight or val arrays, can all be changed within knapsack.py on lines 93, 94
and 97 respectively.
