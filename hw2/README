Ensure all files are present, which are:

    mergesort3.cpp
    merge3Time.cpp
    Makefile
    README

To compile all programs, simply type "make" or "make all" to create the
executables.

If you would like to make just mergesort3.cpp or the merge3Time.cpp,
type "make sort" or "make time",

To run an executable, type "./" before the name of the object file you would
like to run. For example, type "./merge3Time.o" to run that executable.

Making all files should result in the creation of the files below:

    mergesort3.o
    merge3Time.o

Running mergesort3.o should create text files with ordered
results called ""merge3.txt". In these files you will find the ordered lists.

Running merge3Time.o will result in the size of the array and the
time elapsed to be printed to the terminal.

To set the size of the array in the Time function, change the value assigned to n in the functions, which should be line 234 for mergeTime.cpp.
